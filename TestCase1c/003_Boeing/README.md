# Boeing Commercial Airplanes submissions (July. 2025)

Grid convergence study of the ONERA OAT15A airfoil case at M=0.73, Alpha=1.50.
The grids used were generated by Cadence and Heldenmesh, but were modified as follows:
   - OVERFLOW: Converted to 2D (x,z) and extruded to y-planes @ y=[-1,0,+1]
   - FELIGHT:  Converted to 2D (x,y)
